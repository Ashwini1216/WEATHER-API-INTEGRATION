The Weather Information Web Application is a responsive, client-side web project developed using core web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate how real-time data can be fetched from a public Application Programming Interface (API) and dynamically displayed on a webpage in a clear, interactive, and user-friendly manner. This project was completed as part of an internship task to gain hands-on experience with frontend web development concepts, API integration, and responsive user interface design.

The application allows users to enter the name of any city and instantly retrieve the current weather information for that location. It uses the Open-Meteo public API to fetch real-time weather data. Open-Meteo is a free and open public API that does not require authentication or an API key, making it highly suitable for beginner-level academic and internship projects. JavaScript’s Fetch API is used to make asynchronous HTTP requests to the external API and process the received data efficiently.

The webpage dynamically updates its content without requiring a page reload. This behavior is achieved using asynchronous JavaScript programming, which improves performance and ensures a smooth and seamless user experience. The fetched weather data includes current temperature, wind speed, humidity, “feels like” temperature, weather condition codes, and the current date and time. Displaying these additional parameters provides users with more informative and meaningful weather details rather than showing only basic temperature values.

The user interface of the application is designed using CSS with a strong emphasis on simplicity, readability, and responsiveness. A modern card-based layout is implemented to neatly organize and present weather information in a structured manner. Responsive design techniques such as flexible layouts and adaptive styling are used to ensure compatibility across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. Visual enhancements including weather icons and background color changes are applied based on conditions such as clear skies, cloudy weather, or rainfall, making the application more intuitive and visually appealing.

Basic error handling mechanisms are implemented to manage scenarios such as invalid city names, unavailable weather data, or network-related issues. User-friendly error messages are displayed when incorrect input is provided, ensuring the application behaves reliably under different conditions. The project follows a modular development approach by separating HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for logic and API communication, which improves code readability, maintainability, and scalability.

The tools and technologies used in this project include HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, the Fetch API, and the Open-Meteo public API. Visual Studio Code was used as the primary development environment, along with the Live Server extension for local testing and automatic browser refresh. Google Chrome DevTools were utilized for debugging and testing mobile responsiveness. Overall, this project demonstrates practical knowledge of responsive web design, public API usage, asynchronous JavaScript programming, and dynamic content rendering.
